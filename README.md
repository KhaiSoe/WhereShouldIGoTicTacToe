# Where Should I Go... Tic Tac Toe

In Tic-Tac-Toe, two players try to line up three symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row. 
With easy to master rules, this is a good starter strategy game for children, as they learn how to balance their own tactics against those of their opponents (aka their parents). 
Tic-Tac-Toe is a great way of passing a bit of spare time, and you can play it anywhere, as long as you have paper and a pen. 
Or you can also play the game online or as a mobile app download.

This app is for people to play with their friends to pass time and requires no Wi-Fi access.

## Rules
------

Each player competes against each other to line up three same-colored blocks in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row.
May the best player win!
